I have learnt how to use JPA repository in java springboot.

# R
I think the JPA repository interface is quite easy to use.

# I
The repository interface has provided us a lot of annontations and functions, which allows us no need to write a lot SQL statement when dealing with databases, allowing us to be more focused on other design aspect of the API.

Before when I was handling the springboot app at work, I don't quite understand how the repository mechanism works. Now, I am equiped with the fundamental knowledge of repository and ORM. I could better design the repository used in my projects and do quite some refactoring.
